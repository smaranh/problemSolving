# Spiral Traverse

## Problem
Write a function that takes in NxM two-dimensional matrix array and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in a spiral order.

### Sample
```
array = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [12, 13, 14, 5],
    [11, 16, 15, 6],
    [10, 9, 8, 7]
]

Output - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]
```
