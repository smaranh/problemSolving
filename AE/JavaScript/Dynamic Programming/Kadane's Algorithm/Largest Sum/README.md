# Largest Sum

## Problem
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns maximum sum that can be obtained by summing up all the integers in a non-empty sub-array of the input array. A sub-array should only contain adjacent numbers.

### Sample
```
array = [-1, 10, 4, -5, 3, -6, 1]

Output - 14 // [10,4]
```
