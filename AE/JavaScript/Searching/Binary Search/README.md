## Problem
Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers and a target integer. The function should determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is, otherwise `-1`.

### Sample
```
array = [3,67,89,101,450]
target = 101

Output - 3

array = [3,10,13,55,77,89]
target = 58

Output - -1
```
